Known vmrc Issues

1. Many GNU/Linux are configured for ISO boot but not hd0 boot. Know GNU/Linux?
2. Templates prefixed with dyn_ need frequent updating. (i.e. snapshots)
3. There may be a limit to the number of arguments (VMs) that can be fed into an
   rc script: TEST
4. bhyveload has a 31 character VM name limit
5. nmdm consoles are neither reliable nor predictable. Use tmux or screen.
6. "detached" VM's do not auto-cleanup. There may not be a clean way to do this.


Known Feature Requests

Multiple Bridge Support (bridge/tap pairs?)
VM MAC Address Support (Easy with one NIC, not for multiple)
