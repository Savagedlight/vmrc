Known vmrc Issues

1. Many GNU/Linux are configured for ISO boot but not hd0 boot. Know GNU/Linux?
2. Templates prefixed with dyn_ need frequent updating. (i.e. snapshots)
3. bhyveload has a 31 character VM name limit
4. FreeBSD creates superflous tap0 devices and runs dhcp on them
5. Templates using "Latest" rawimg images will not know to update if they change
6. cu processes on idle nmdm devices can go nuts
7. "load" gives a grub prompt with unconfigured HDs. Could be more elegant?

Known Feature Requests

DONE: Multiple Bridge Support (bridge/tap pairs?)
DONE: VM MAC Address Support (Easy with one NIC, not for multiple)
API support (Beyond the fact that rc has not changed in decades)
