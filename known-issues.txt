Welcome brave soul,

This has a few know issues and concerns but I am attending to them ASAP:

1. The Centos65*, Debian and Ubuntu templates appear to work. The others 
   require configuration.
2. Templates prefixed with dyn_ need frequent updating i.e. snapshots.
3. There may be a limit to the number of arguments (VMs) that can be fed into an
   rc script: TEST
4. bhyveload has a 31 character vm name limit
5. Whatever else you find.

Thanks!
