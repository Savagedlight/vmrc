Known vmrc Issues

1. Not all GNU/Linux templates are updated to the new syntax. Not all work. 
2. Templates prefixed with dyn_ need frequent updating. (i.e. snapshots)
3. There may be a limit to the number of arguments (VMs) that can be fed into an
   rc script: TEST
4. bhyveload has a 31 character VM name limit
5. "detached" VM's do not auto-cleanup
6. /etc/rc: WARNING: $vm_enable is not set properly - see rc.conf(5).

Thanks!
