Known vmrc Issues

1. Many GNU/Linux are configured for ISO boot but not hd0 boot. Know GNU/Linux?
2. Templates prefixed with dyn_ need frequent updating. (i.e. snapshots)
3. bhyveload has a 31 character VM name limit
4. FreeBSD creates superflous tap0 devices and runs dhcp on them
5. Templates using "Latest" rawimg images will not update - check timestamps?
6. cu processes on idle nmdm devices can go nuts

Known Feature Requests

Multiple Bridge Support (bridge/tap pairs?)
VM MAC Address Support (Easy with one NIC, not for multiple)
