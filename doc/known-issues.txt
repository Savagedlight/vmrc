Known vmrc Issues/To do

1. bhyveload has a 31 character VM name limit
2. Note the many inline "NB!" comments
3. Consider PCI slot renumbering for muliple AHCI devices (0:0:0)
	Will not work (yet) with UEFI VMs
3a. EFI can ONLY support one slot 3,4,5 and 6. making for 4 ahci devices max
4. Integrate the repack into mkvm.sh
5. Compeletely separate install.img support. Ending rename probably isn't enough
6. Template updates
7. Consider dtach along with tmux and screen
8. Sync the rc directives
9. Add PCI pass-through support
10. NetBSD 7 broke between vBSDcon and EuroBSDcon 
     Status: Command failed
    Command: /sbin/mount -rt cd9660 /dev/cd0a /mnt2
11. Xen networking may need attention, along with multiple disk support
12. vmrcd will obliterate many configuration options such as multipel disks

Features to be restored:

* Multiple NIC support
* ZVOLS
* Optional fsck
* nmdm consoles
* mount directive
