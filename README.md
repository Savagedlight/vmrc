## NOTICE
As this is a work in progress, please consider submitting questions and feature requests prior to patches.

If you do submit pull requests, note that GitHub will combine requests until they are accepted as a group. This inadvertently makes them inseparable and thus unacceptable, arguably defeating the entire purpose of Git. One workaround is to submit each request from a different local branch.

Thank you for helping test bhyve, Xen  and vmrc!
